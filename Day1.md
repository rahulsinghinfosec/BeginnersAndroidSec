<h1>Day 1</h1>
</h3>The basics</h3>
<p><b>Why perform staitic code analysis?</b></p>
<p>When it comes to black box penetration testing, a hacker/pentester will tinker with those functionalities that are visible to him in the environment.
So, there are changes that he/she might skip some core and important functionalities.</p> 
<p>Also a penetration tester will only be able to do assessments and PT as per his/her skill level, as the applications these days are too complex and involve mulitiple
frameworks and dependencies.</p>
<p>So,some misconfigurations and bugs might skip the black box approach. Once the application is deployed and available to the public, some malicious actor might actually
find or come across those misconfigurations and bugs while tinkering with the application.</p>


<p>Advantages of code analysis</p>
<ul>
  <li>In depth analysis of all the core functionalities.</li>
  <li>The presence of harmful functions can be checked.</li>
  <li>The presence of misconfigurations can be checked.</li>
  <li>Helps you enchance your knowlege in Android Security.</li>
</ul>

<p>Which languages can I expect the code to be in? </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Java</b></li>
  <p>Java was the official language to code in before Kotlin. It has a simple and plain syntax but also can be quite complicated.</p>
  <p>The complexity could be due to constructors, null pointer exceptions, concurrency checked exception,etc.</p>
  
  <li><b>Kotlin</b></li>
  <p>It is not the official language of Android. It was developed by Google, and it is strikingly similar to Java. It runs on the same JVM as Java did.</p>
  <p>Users don't have to worry about null pointer exceptions and other stuff, and no need to end a statement with a semi-colon</p>
  
  <li><b>C++</b></li>
  <p>You can develop Android Apps using C++ but using Android Native Environment</p>
  <p>This is not what Google recommends</p>
  
  <li><b>C#</b></li>
  <p>An android app can also be developed using C#.The syntax is similar to Java, and there are no memeory leaks issue, was it is with C language</p>
  
  <li><b>Python</b></li>
  <p>Though an android phone has a JVM to run the Java byte code, when the application is made to run on a mobile phone, yet you can develop an android app using Python.</p>
  <p>This can be achieved by using tools that convert python apps into Android packages that can run on android devices.</p>
  <p>Example: Kivy</p>
  
  <li><b>Corona</b></li>
  <p>It is a Software Development Kit, that can be used to develop android apps using Lua</p>
  <p>Lua has less functionalities when it comes to comparison with Java, and hence this makes learning Lua easy.</p>
</ul>
